# Lab: Introduction to Tuning & Troubleshooting

## Introduction

This lab provides the basis of the hands-on part of the "Introduction to Apache Flink Tuning & Troubleshooting"
training by Ververica. Please follow the [Setup Instructions](../../README.md#setup-your-development-environment) first
and then continue reading here.

### Infrastructure

During the training, participants will be asked to run the Flink job `TroubledStreamingJob` locally as well as on
Ververica Platform.

### Running Locally

Executing `com.ververica.flink.training.exercises.TroubledStreamingJob#main()` with `--local true` will create a local
Flink cluster running the troubled streaming job.

Once running, you can access Flink's Web UI via http://localhost:8081.

### The Flink Job

This simple Flink job reads measurement data from a Kafka topic with eight partitions. For the purpose of this training,
the `KafkaConsumer` is replaced by `FakeKafkaSource`. The result of a calculation based on the measurement value is
averaged over 1 second. The overall flow is depicted below:

                                                                                            \
                                                                                             \               +--------------------+
                                                                                              \              |                    |
                                                                                               +-----------> | Sink: LateDataSink |    
                                                                                                             |                    |
                                                                                                             +--------------------+
```

In local mode, the sinks print their values on `stdout` (NormalOutput) and `stderr` (LateDataSink), which simplifies debugging.
Otherwise, a `DiscardingSink` is used for each sink.
